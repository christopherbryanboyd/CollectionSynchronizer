# CollectionSynchronizer
**GarbageDisposal** is a Java library for synchronizing Collections with a backend service, preserving the Identity Hashcode of the original entries. 

This library uses the [decorator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) to *decorate* an object, wrapping the specified callback in a RunnableCloseable.
